Assignment 07: Exception Handling and Pickling Demo

Introduction	
This week I learned about exception handling and pickling. Exception handling is a process that allows the programmer to create special error messages for possible errors that they think a user might encounter. When Python finds an error, it spits out an error message, however, these messages are not always intuitive for a user. Exception handling is a way to make the error messages more useful to the user. Pickling is a way to save data in a binary format versus a plain text format. Some benefits of using pickling is that using binary format makes the information more obscure to human eyes and can reduce the size of the file. To demonstrate exception handling and pickling, I created a simple program that takes in user entered data and does simple division. The user entered data and quotient output are stored in a dictionary that is written to a binary file.
